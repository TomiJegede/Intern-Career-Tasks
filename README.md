As part of my **Remote Data Analyst Intern** role with Intern Career, I worked on two insightful data analysis projects. 
These projects challenged me to analyze complex datasets, handle inconsistencies, and extract meaningful insights. Below are the details of the projects I completed.

# YouTube Streamer Analysis Project
This project involved identifying trends and analyzing performance metrics for popular YouTube streamers. 
I focused on tackling data inconsistencies in subscriber counts, likes, comments, and views, and introduced a new performance metric based on average subscribers.

## Key Highlights:

• Data Cleaning & Transformation: Using Excel to handle missing and inaccurate data.

• Advanced Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis and created interactive visualizations using Tableau.

• Statistical Insights: Leveraged R for statistical analysis to identify trends and patterns.

## Tools & Technologies:
• Excel

• Tableau

• R

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in data wrangling, visualization, and storytelling, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

# Global Terrorism Data Analysis with Power BI
For this project, I analyzed a comprehensive dataset on global terrorism from 1970-2017 to uncover trends and patterns in terrorism worldwide. 
Using Power BI, I created interactive visualizations to communicate my findings.

## Key Findings:
1. Yearly Trends in Terrorist Attacks: Significant upward trend in global terrorism, with notable spikes during the 2000s.

2. Geographical Insights: Countries such as Iraq, Pakistan, and Afghanistan experienced the highest number of attacks.

3. Common Types of Attacks: Bombings and armed assaults were the most frequent attack methods.

4. Victim Profiles: Private citizens, police, and military personnel were the most targeted groups.

## Tools & Technologies:
• Power BI

• Excel

This project provided me with a deeper understanding of terrorism data and honed my ability to work with large datasets to generate insights that inform global issues.

## Let’s Connect!
I’m excited to continue growing my skills in data analytics and working on more challenging projects.
